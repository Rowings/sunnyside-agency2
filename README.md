## The mission

![desktop preview](./desktop-preview.jpg)

You've been asked to implement a design for a newly created agency.

The graphic designer gave you all the elements so you can code the thing yourself. You have one day, but with the power of flexboxes and grids you should be able to make it!

- The [desktop design](./resources/desktop-design.jpg) end product should match this image
- The [mobile design](./resources/mobile-design.jpg) end product should match this image
  - You don't need to implement the burger menu on the mobile view yet, just focus on the rest of the elements.

Good luck!
